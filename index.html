                  applications and ensuring everything runs smoothly. I also
                  lead projects to upgrade old systems to newer, more efficient
                  technologies, greatly improving how they function and align
                  with our business needs. I work closely with our team to spot

                  the same direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Together with our CIO, I help decide what our tech team should
                  focus on next. I'm involved in testing, tweaking, and rolling
                  out software updates to make sure they work perfectly. We also
                  organize user testing sessions to make sure everything we
