                <h2>Sr. Software Engineer</h2>
                <p>
                  As a Senior Software Engineer at Qube, I play a key role in
                  full-stack web application development, drawing on my
                  experience with JavaScript (Angular, React, Expo), HTML/CSS,
                  C#, and SQL databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My key leadership contributions have been instrumental in
                  advancing our technology stack and improved development
                  processes.
                </p>
                <h3>Achievements</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Spearheaded the development of a lightweight React Native
                    wrapper, enabling our main web application to be installed
                    on company-controlled tablets. This solution unified
                    multiple applications and streamlined operations across the
                    organization.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Led the migration and modernization of key projects:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>FieldOps (Field Operations)</strong>:
                        Successfully migrated from MVC integrating it into the
                        main web application.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Estimate system</strong>: Directed the
                        migration, improving functionality and user experience.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        For both projects, I drove the simplification of user
                        flows, collaborating closely with stakeholders and
                        product owners to address user pain points through
                        iterative meetings and design sessions.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ensured high frontend code quality across all projects,
                        implementing best practices and maintaining consistent
                        coding standards.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    These migrations are now in production, being used
                    company-wide across multiple depots in New Zealand and
                    Australia.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Sr. Front-End Developer</h2>
                <p>
                  At Liquid Interactive, a premier interactive marketing agency,
                  I specialized in interactive strategy, marketing, UX design,
                  website design and development, and mobile technologies. My
                  role involved creating platforms for institutions, enabling
                  program and framework management across various stakeholders
                  such as school leaders, staff, and students, accessible from
                  desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was also deployed in Australia to set the code benchmark for
                  Dreamworks game projects, developing mini-game apps that
                  allowed users to interact with their favorite DreamWorks
                  characters. Initially I explored Three.js for its 3D
                  capabilities. However, after research and prototyping, I
                  ultimately chose Phaser.js as my primary development
                  framework. Phaser.js offered several advantages for our
                  specific use case:

                    mechanics.

                  <li>Better performance for 2D games on mobile devices.</li>
